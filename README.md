# Faster-Taxi-Tip-Prediction-using-Snap-ML
Introduction
The dataset used in this exercise session is publicly available here: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page (all rights reserved by Taxi & Limousine Commission(TLC), City of New York). The TLC Yellow Taxi Trip Records of June, 2019 are used in this notebook. The prediction of the tip amount can be modeled as a regression problem. To train the model you can use part of the input dataset and the remaining data can be used to assess the quality of the trained model. First, let's download the dataset.
